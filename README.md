# Amazon
A C++ program which implements  same functions as that are in amazon.in using Graphics, file handling and Data Structure.

This Code is written in Turbo c++

## How to use

1. Install Turbo C++ using this link - https://bit.ly/2JHvklv. If you already have Turbo C++ installed in your PC you can skip first point.
2. First thing first, to use graphics you have to copy BGI folder and paste it in the BIN folder.
3. Copy the code in a new file and you are all set to run this code.

## How this code run?

1. Initially, it executes screen 1 by default, which is the first page of the project, which will show a moving cart and some details like creator's name etc.
2. Then it asks for some values, i.e., which task you want to perform.
3. The whole code is menu-driven so it will execute everything as user commands.

## Some Prerequisite Statement you should need to know

1. graphdefaults()      - Function resets all graphics settings to their defaults.
2. setbkcolor()         - Function changes current background color 
3. setcolor()           - Function which is used to set the current drawing color to the new color
4. outtextxy()          - Function which displays the text or string at a specified point (x, y) on the screen
5. arc()                - Function which draws an arc with center at (x, y) and given radius
6. line()               - Function is used to draw a line from a point(x1,y1) to point(x2,y2)
7. pieslice()           - It draws and fills a pie slice with center at (x, y) and given radius r.
8. circle()             - Function which draws a circle with center at (x, y) and given radius.
9. rectangle()          - It is used to draw a rectangle.
10. settextstyle()      - Function which is used to change the way in which text appears.
11. setusercharsize()   - You specify factors by which the width and height are scaled.
12. initgraph()         - Initializes the graphics system by loading a graphics driver from disk (or validating a registered driver), and putting the system into graphics mode.
13. sleep()             - Function makes the program sleep for x seconds
14. delay()             - Function is used to hold the program's execution for given number of milliseconds
15. closegraph()        - Function which closes the graphics mode, deallocates all memory allocated by graphics system and restores the screen to the mode it was in before you called initgraph.
